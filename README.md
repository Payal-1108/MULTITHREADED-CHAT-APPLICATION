MENTOR NAME : Neela Santhosh Kumar

DESCRIPTION :

A client-server chat application allows multiple users to communicate with each other in real time. This type of application requires efficient handling of network connections and concurrent data exchange, making Java sockets and multithreading ideal for its implementation.

In this project, we will build a client-server chat system where:

A central server manages connections from multiple clients.

Each client can send and receive messages.

Messages are broadcasted to all connected users.

Multithreading ensures smooth communication without blocking.

This application will demonstrate essential networking concepts such as socket programming, thread management, and inter-thread communication while ensuring an efficient real-time chat experience.

Key Features of the Chat Application

Client-Server Communication: A server listens for client connections and facilitates message exchange.

Multithreading: Each client runs on a separate thread to enable simultaneous messaging.

Broadcast Messaging: Messages sent by one client are relayed to all other connected users.

User Identification: Each client has a unique username for personalized communication.

Error Handling: The system gracefully manages client disconnections and network errors.
